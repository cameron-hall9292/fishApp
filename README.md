This fishing app is my first attempt at creating what would be considered a fullstack application with most emphasis being on the backend. The project is being built with node, express, mongoDB, and passport.js. 

The idea behind the application is to track fishing data. A fisherman could use this app to easily log data such as bait used, fishtype caught, body of water they are fishing, and weather data as well via fetching weather data from an open weather api. 
I want my app to standout by focusing on efficiency of logging data and efficiency of patterning via things like data visualizations with charts and tables. To build charts, I am using chart.js. I have also added map tracking via a js library called Leaflet. 
Basically, location data is used to save fishing spots and then render them on a map via leaflet and openstreetmap. 

When I am finished with this project, what I want for my user is the ability to pull their phone out, open the app, take a picture of a fish they just caught, enter the fish type, bait used, body of water they are fishing at, and then finally, they can hit submit 
and the catch is logged. The amount of button presses could be greatly reduced with the use of A.I. to identify the fish type in the picture the user submits, but creating such a thing is a rather lofty and time consuming goal. My main focus is to learn programming,
not machine learning, so I may explore 3rd party options for the A.I. part.
